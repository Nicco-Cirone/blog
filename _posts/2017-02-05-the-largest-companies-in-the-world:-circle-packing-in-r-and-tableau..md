Since version 8, Tableau offers a native circle-packing algorithm to produce bubble charts.

Of course, bubble charts are all but best practices when it comes to data visualizations, and dataviz expert Stephen Few even [ranted](http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1532) against the software when they introduced this option.

However, despite not being great as a data visualization type, circle-packing is a technique with a long and interesting story. As it usually happens in math, circle-packing was born in ancient Grece, with the name of ["Apollonius' Tangency Problem"](http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath113/kmath113.htm).

 

If you are interested in the mathematic side of circle-packing, [here](http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath113/kmath113.htm) is a good resource, and [here](http://www.maecla.it/tartapelago/frattali/index3.htm) the research my uncle Giorgio did on Apollonian fractals using logo programming language.
