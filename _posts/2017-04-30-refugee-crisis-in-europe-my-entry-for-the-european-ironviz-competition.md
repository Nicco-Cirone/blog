Since 2010, the unstable situation in the middle east generated a massive inflow of migrants in all European countries. Through different routes, people illegally cross borders until they ask asylum and apply for refugee status in a chosen country. However, too many people don't make the final destination, as they disappear - or die - in the mediterranean sea, or on their way to a better life.

I gathered data on refugee status applications in European countries, illegal crossing of European borders, and people who disappeared or died trying to reach Europe.

The final result aims to illustrate the hope-guided journey of people who risk everything for the simple hope of a better and safer life for themselves and their families.

No person is illegal.
